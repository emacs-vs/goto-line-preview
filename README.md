Normally `goto-line` will just ask for input of the line number then once you hit 
`RET`; it will just go to that line of code. This package makes this better by 
navigating the line while you are inputting in minibuffer.

*P.S. Inspired by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) goto line preset behavior.*

## 🔧 Usage

Call it from `minibuffer` directly, 

```
M-x goto-line-preview
```

Or you can bind it globally to replace `goto-line`:

```el
(global-set-key [remap goto-line] 'goto-line-preview)
```

## Change hightlight color or duration

```el
;; Highlight 1.5 seconds when change preview line
(setq goto-line-preview-hl-duration 1.5)

;; Change highlight background color to white
(setq goto-line-preview-hl-color "white")
```

If you want to close highlight, set `goto-line-preview-hl-duration` to 0 or `nil`.
